# IoT-Based Smart Vehicle Safety System 

##  Overview
This project implements an intelligent vehicle safety and monitoring system using NodeMCU (ESP8266), gas sensors, temperature sensors, and vibration modules. It aims to detect hazardous driving conditions, vehicle overheating, and environmental threats, and sends real-time alerts to the user via IoT dashboards.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Real-time gas leakage detection (MQ-2 Sensor)
- Vehicle temperature monitoring
- Vibration and crash detection
- Data transmission using NodeMCU over Wi-Fi
- Dashboard alerts and safety warnings

##  Tech Stack
- **Hardware:** NodeMCU (ESP8266), MQ-2 Gas Sensor, LM35 Temperature Sensor, Vibration Sensor
- **Software:** Arduino IDE, Blynk IoT App / Firebase (optional)
- **Languages:** C++, Arduino

##  Future Improvements
